        Tia (Tia Mowry) and Tamera (Tamera Mowry) are twins who are seperated at birth. Tamera is then
        adopted by Ray Campbell (Tim Reid) and Tia is adopted by Lisa Landry (Jackee Harry). They aren't
        reunited until they are in high school at the mall. After they get to
        know eachother, the parents agree to move in to Ray's house so the twins
        could be together. The twins look alike, but are very different
        inside, the adoptive parents also don't get along at first. This story follows
        the twins' experiences through high school and their first year of college.
        They go through normal experiences like any teen, but with a humorous
        twist.
